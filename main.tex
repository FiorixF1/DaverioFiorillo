\begin{verse}
	Many endeavors require scheduling meetings at various locations all across a city or a region (e.g., around Lombardy), whether for work or personal reasons (e.g., meeting the CEO of a partner company, going to the gym, taking children to practice, etc.). The goal of this project is to create a calendar-based application that: (i) automatically computes and accounts for travel time between appointments to make sure that the user is not late for appointments; and (ii) supports the user in his/her travels, for example by identifying the best mobility option (e.g., use the train from A to B and then the metro to C), buying public transportation tickets, or by locating the nearest bike of a bike sharing system. Users can create meetings, and when meetings are created at locations that are unreachable in the allotted time, a warning is created. As mentioned, the application should also suggest travel means depending on the appointment (e.g., perhaps you bike to the office in the morning, but the bus is a better choice between a pair of afternoon meetings, and a car – either personal, or of a car-sharing system – is best to take children to practice) and the day (e.g., the app should suggest that you leave your home via car in the morning because meetings during a strike day will not be doable via public transportation; it could also take into account the weather forecast, and avoid biking during rainy days). Travlendar+ should allow users to define various kinds of user preferences. It should support a multitude of travel means, including walking, biking (own or shared), public transportation (including taxis), driving (own or shared), etc. A particular user may globally activate or deactivate each travel means (e.g., a user who cannot drive would deactivate driving). A user should also be able to provide reasonable constraints on different travel means (e.g., walking distances should be less than a given distance, or public transportation should not be used after a given time of day). Users should also be able, if they wish to, to select combinations of transportation means that minimize carbon footprint. Additional features could also be envisioned, for instance allowing a user to specify a flexible "lunch". For instance, a user could be able to specify that lunch must be possible every day between 11:30- 2:30, and it must be at least half an hour long, but the specific timing is flexible. The app would then be sure to reserve at least 30 minutes for lunch each day. Similarly, other types of breaks might be scheduled in a customizable way
